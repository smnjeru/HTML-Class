	<p style="text-align:center, font-family:verdana;">  It's a story about entrepreneur, and risk, and hard work, and<mark> knowing where you want to go and being willing to do what it takes to get there</mark>. And it's a story about believing in your idea even when maybe some other folks don't, and about sticking to your guns. Sam Walton. Meet a genuine American folk hero cut from the homespun cloth of America's heartland: Sam Walton, who turned a single dime store in a hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world. The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, Sam never lost the common touch. Here, finally, Sam Walton tells his extraordinary story in his won inimitable words. Genuinely modest, but always sure of his ambitious and achievements, Sam shares his thinking in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style.

	<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>IF THE GRASS IS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE... </b>
It's probably getting better care. Success is not a matter of luck or circumstance. It's not a matter of fate or the breaks you get or who you know. 
<mark>Success is a matter of sticking to a set of commonsense principles anyone can master.</mark> In Lead the Field Earl Nightingale explains these guidelines: the magic word in life is ATTITUDE. It determines your actions, as well as the actions of others. It tells the world what you expect from it. When you accept responsibility for your attitude, you accept responsibility for your entire life.
